Configuration &amp; GCODE Files for using a Printrbot Metal Simple with a Duet Wifi board

This is a work in progress and not a final set of configurations. It's my first time building/configuring a 3d Printer so there ARE errors that I don't know about yet. Use at your own risk, I assume no responsability for you destroying your electronics and/or  motors, sensors, hotend, or burning your house down becuase you used this configuration and left your printer unattended.
